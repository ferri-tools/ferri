# Log for 2025-09-10-20-03-14

This log summarizes the actions taken to create an initial commit for the Ferri project.

1.  **Initial Exploration:**
    *   Listed the contents of the `development_resources` directory to understand the project's context.
    *   Read the contents of the files within `development_resources` to gather information for a README.

2.  **README Creation:**
    *   Synthesized the information from `help_commands_demo.txt` and `product_versions.csv` into a comprehensive `README.md` file.

3.  **First Commit Attempt:**
    *   Staged all project files using `git add .`.
    *   Committed the files with the message "Initial commit with project structure and documentation".
    *   **Mistake:** This initial commit incorrectly included the `target` build directory.

4.  **Correcting the Commit:**
    *   The `target` directory was removed from the git index using `git rm -r --cached target`.
    *   The `.gitignore` file was updated to exclude the `target` directory.
    *   The commit was amended to remove the `target` directory from the project's history.

5.  **Correcting the `.gitignore`:**
    *   It was discovered that the `.gitignore` file was overwritten in the previous step, removing the original rule to ignore `development_resources`.
    *   The `.gitignore` file was corrected to include both `/target/` and `/development_resources/`.
    *   The commit was amended a second time to reflect the corrected `.gitignore`.

6.  **Final Verification:**
    *   `git status` was run to confirm that the working directory is clean and the commit is now correct.
