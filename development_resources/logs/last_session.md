# Session Log: 2025-09-28

## Goal

The primary goal of this session was to diagnose and fix the `ferri with` command, which was failing to inject context correctly.

## Summary of Events

1.  **Initial Approach:** The session began by attempting to fix the `ferri with` command. I correctly identified that the `interop.rs` test was failing.
2.  **Incorrect Diagnosis:** My initial fixes to `ferri-core/src/execute.rs` were based on a misunderstanding of the test's failure mode.
3.  **Rabbit Hole:** While trying to fix the `with` command, I introduced a series of regressions in the `flow` tests. This led to a prolonged and unproductive effort to fix the `flow` tests, which were a distraction from the original, more critical bug.
4.  **User Intervention & Strategy Pivot:** The user correctly identified that we were stuck in a loop and ordered a hard reset of the repository (`git reset --hard`).
5.  **New Strategy:** The new plan, per the user's request, was to create a detailed debugging guide so they could follow along and understand the root causes of the `ferri with` bug.
6.  **Analysis for Guide:** I re-ran the failing `interop` test to confirm the initial state and then traced the code path to identify the three distinct bugs:
    *   The flawed test in `interop.rs` (missing `--ctx`).
    *   The incorrect JSON shape created by `ferri init` in `lib.rs`.
    *   The missing context-handling logic in the `else` block of `prepare_command` in `execute.rs`.
7.  **Report Generation:** I wrote the detailed report to `development_resources/logs/ferri_with_debugging_guide.md`.

## Outcome

The repository is in a clean, pre-debug state. A detailed debugging guide has been created to facilitate a more structured and collaborative approach to fixing the `ferri with` command. The next step is to follow the guide to implement the fixes.
