**User Prompt:** Work on issue #17.
**Summary of Actions:**
- Used `gh issue view 17` to understand the issue requirements.
- Created a feature branch `feature/define-core-yaml-schema` to isolate the work.
- Searched the codebase for existing schema definitions and found them in `crates/ferri-automation/src/flow.rs`.
- Inspected the git history of `crates/ferri-automation/src/flow.rs` using `git log`.
- Discovered that the required structs were already implemented in commit `379e7981` as part of issue #15.
- Concluded that issue #17 is a duplicate.
- Switched back to the `main` branch and deleted the feature branch.
**Final State:** No code changes were made. The feature branch was deleted. Issue #17 was identified as a duplicate and is recommended for closure.
