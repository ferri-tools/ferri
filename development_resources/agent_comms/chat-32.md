**User Prompt:** Mount workspaces into job execution environment so steps can access them.
**Summary of Actions:**
- Read flow.rs to understand StepWorkspace definition (name, mount_path, read_only)
- Created feature/32-mount-workspaces from feature/31-temp-workspaces
- Added build_workspace_paths() method to create name-to-path mapping (lines 68-80)
- Modified execute() to build workspace paths and pass to execute_wave (lines 44-66)
- Updated execute_wave signature to accept workspace_paths parameter (line 186)
- Threaded workspace_paths through execution chain:
  - execute_wave → execute_job (lines 207-218)
  - execute_job → execute_step (lines 277, 307-315)
  - execute_step → execute_run_step (lines 346-356, 391-401)
- In execute_run_step, set FERRI_WORKSPACE_<NAME> env vars for each workspace (lines 407-421)
- Added validation to return error if workspace name not found in flow spec
- Added test_workspace_paths_mapping to verify mapping logic (lines 765-818)
- Ran cargo build and cargo test - all tests pass
- Committed changes
- Pushed feature branch to origin
- Created PR #40 targeting develop branch (depends on #31)
- Updated issue #32 with PR link
- Unassigned self from issue #32
**Final State:** Implementation complete. PR #40 created. Workspaces are exposed to steps via FERRI_WORKSPACE_<NAME> environment variables. All tests passing.
