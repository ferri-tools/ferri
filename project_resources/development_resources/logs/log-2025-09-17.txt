# Session Log: 2025-09-17

## Summary
This session focused on fixing a broken `ferri flow run` command. The initial state of the repository was unstable after previous attempts to implement streaming for remote models.

## Key Events & Pivots

1.  **Initial State & Reset:** The session began with the repository in a broken state. The user requested a clean wipe, preserving only the `pm/sprint_backlog.csv` file.
    *   Action: Successfully reset the repository to `HEAD` and preserved the backlog.

2.  **TUI Error:** After the reset, running a flow immediately resulted in an `Error: Flow execution failed - Device not configured (os error 6)`. This indicated that the TUI could not be rendered in the current non-interactive environment.

3.  **First Attempted Fix (TTY Check):** I attempted to fix the TUI error by adding the `atty` crate to detect if the CLI was running in an interactive terminal and fall back to a plain text output if not.
    *   **Failure Loop:** This led to a series of repeated compilation errors, including syntax errors, typos, and mismatched `use` statements. I got stuck in a loop and failed to resolve these issues efficiently.

4.  **Strategy Pivot 1 (Async Refactor):** After the repeated failures, I identified the blocking nature of the code as a potential root cause and proposed a complete asynchronous refactor using `tokio`.
    *   **Failure Loop 2:** This new direction proved to be even more complex. I introduced numerous compilation errors related to `async` Rust, including lifetime issues, runtime errors in tests (`Cannot drop a runtime in a context where blocking is not allowed`), and type mismatches between `std::process::Command` and `tokio::process::Command`. My attempts to fix these were also inefficient and resulted in a loop.

5.  **Strategy Pivot 2 (Git Revert):** The user expressed frustration with the lack of progress and the complexity of the `async` approach. Following the user's guidance, we pivoted to a much safer and more reliable strategy: reverting the repository to a known-good state.
    *   Action: Systematically created tickets (T42) to treat the revert as a feature.
    *   Action: Successfully reset the repository to commit `84b38ca` ("fix(flow): Finalize logging and streaming for demo"), which was the last known stable state for the core logic.
    *   Action: Preserved the backlog across the reset.

6.  **Current State & Path Forward:**
    *   The repository is now in a stable, synchronous state.
    *   The "Device not configured" error has reappeared, as expected.
    *   We have systematically re-implemented the TTY check (T43) and confirmed that the plain-text streaming now works correctly.
    *   We are now properly positioned to tackle the original goal: implementing true, visible streaming for remote models (T44).

SESSION END: 2025-09-17
GOAL: Create and implement ticket for `ferri models rm` feature.

KEY EVENTS:
- Created Ticket T45 to track the implementation of `ferri models rm`.
- Modified `ferri-core/src/models.rs` to have the `remove_model` function execute `ollama rm` for models with the `ollama` provider.
- Updated `ferri-cli/src/main.rs` to include an interactive "y/N" confirmation prompt before deleting a model.
- Updated the corresponding integration tests in `ferri-cli/tests/models.rs` to handle the new interactive prompt.

FAILURES & LEARNING:
- The test suite was in a broken state, leading to a significant debugging effort.
- Initial test failures were caused by incorrect imports (`PathBuf`, `assert_cmd::Command`) and incorrect binary names (`ferri-cli` vs. `ferri`) within various test files. These were fixed.
- A major, unresolved issue was discovered: all tests in `ferri-cli/tests/flow.rs` are failing due to a `serde_yaml` parsing error. This indicates a breaking change was made to the `flow.yml` structure (likely the `process` step), but the tests were not updated accordingly.

OUTCOME:
- The core functionality for T45 was completed and is working, according to user confirmation.
- The session was concluded before the unrelated `flow.rs` test failures could be resolved. The overall test suite remains in a failing state.

# Session Log: 2025-09-17 (Continued)

## Goal
The primary goal of this session was to diagnose and fix a critical bug where remote model steps in a `ferri flow` were not streaming their output to the UI in real-time.

## Key Events & Debugging Journey

1.  **Initial Diagnosis & Failed Fixes:** The session began by confirming the bug using the `hybrid_model_test_plan.md`. My initial debugging attempts were a series of incorrect hypotheses that led to a frustrating loop:
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Incorrect API endpoint. (Corrected, but did not fix the issue).
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** Flawed byte-buffer parsing logic. (Refactored, but did not fix the issue).
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** The stream was Server-Sent Events (SSE). (Implemented an SSE parser, which was incorrect and did not work).

2.  **The Breakthrough (User-Provided Logs):** The turning point came when the user provided detailed logs from a flow run. The logs revealed that the Gemini API was not using SSE, but was instead sending a single, incrementally delivered JSON array. My parsers were failing because they were not designed to handle this specific format.

3.  **The Final, Correct Fix:** With the correct diagnosis, I replaced the faulty parsers with a robust streaming JSON array parser in `ferri-core/src/flow.rs`. This logic correctly identifies the boundaries of the JSON objects within the array as they arrive, parses them, and extracts the text.

4.  **Local Process Deadlock:** After fixing the remote streaming, we discovered a new bug where `process` steps would hang indefinitely. This was caused by the parent `ferri` process failing to pipe the step's input data to the child process's `stdin`.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented correct `stdin` piping in `ferri-core/src/flow.rs` to resolve the deadlock.

## Additional Work

*   **QA Documentation:** Created a new test plan, `qa/local_process_flow_test_plan.md`, to document and test flows that combine AI models with local shell commands like `grep` and `sed`. Fixed a YAML formatting bug in this documentation.
*   **Backlog Cleanup:** Analyzed the sprint backlog, and per the user's request, marked the large asynchronous refactor (T40) and its related testing tickets as "Descoped" to focus the project on core features.
*   **`secrets rm` Command:** Fully implemented the `ferri secrets rm` command (T39), including the core logic, CLI subcommand, and unit tests.
*   **CSV Formatting:** Cleaned up the `pm/sprint_backlog.csv` file to remove trailing commas that were breaking rendering.

## Outcome
The session was highly successful. The critical remote streaming bug was fixed, a deadlock in local process execution was resolved, the `secrets rm` feature was completed, and the backlog was significantly cleaned up. All changes were committed and pushed to the remote repository.

## Next Steps (Interrupted)
Just before the session ended due to a full context window, the user requested to begin work on adding image support (both understanding and generation) to `ferri`. This will be the starting point for our next session.
