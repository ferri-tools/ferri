# Session Log: 2025-09-19

## Summary
This session focused on implementing multimodal capabilities, specifically image generation, and beginning the process of creating a TUI for the `ps` command. We successfully implemented image generation for both `ferri with` and `ferri flow`, but encountered significant challenges and debugging loops along the way.

## Key Events & Decisions
1.  **Image Generation (`ferri with` - T48):** We successfully implemented the core logic for generating an image from a remote model and saving it to a file using the `--output` flag.
2.  **Debugging Loop (Google API `429` Error):** We spent a significant amount of time debugging a `429 Too Many Requests` error. My initial hypotheses (API key in URL, missing Project ID, User-Agent header) were incorrect. The issue was ultimately resolved by the user providing a new, valid API key.
3.  **Minimal Test Case:** The breakthrough in debugging the `429` error came from creating a minimal, standalone Rust project to isolate the API call. This proved the issue was external to the `ferri` codebase.
4.  **Image Generation (`ferri flow` - T49 & T50):** We successfully integrated the image generation logic into the flow system, allowing a `ModelStep` to output an image. We then created an advanced flow where a local model generates a prompt for the remote image model.
5.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed a bug where `ferri run` could not execute complex shell commands (like `while` loops).
    *   Fixed a bug where `stderr` from local `ollama` commands (e.g., spinner animations) was corrupting the output files in a flow.
6.  **`ps` TUI Implementation (T51):** We began work on the cyberpunk-themed `ps` dashboard. I created the initial TUI module and boilerplate, but introduced several compilation errors due to carelessness, which we then fixed.

## Failures & Learnings
*   **Incorrect Assumptions:** I made several incorrect assumptions about the cause of the Google API error, which wasted significant time. The key learning is to isolate external dependencies with a minimal test case much earlier in the process.
*   **Careless Errors:** I introduced numerous compilation errors by moving too quickly and not double-checking my work (e.g., missing imports, incorrect function signatures, misplaced `mod` declarations). I need to be more deliberate and careful.
*   **Backlog Management:** I lost track of the `ps` TUI tickets during a branch reset, which required the user to remind me. I need to be more diligent in managing the state of the backlog across git operations.

## Outcome
- Image generation is fully implemented and merged to `main`.
- The `ps` TUI is in a compilable state with the basic placeholder UI, but the work is not yet complete. The changes are on the `feature/T51-ps-dashboard` branch.
