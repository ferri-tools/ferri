,E1,"The Foundation - Getting Started with Ferri","This is all about the ""out-of-the-box"" experience. When a developer first tries Ferri, they should be able to get it set up in their project and configured in minutes. This epic builds that smooth on-ramp and establishes the core building blocks of the tool."
,E2,"The Core Workflow - Putting AI to Work","This is the heart of Ferri's daily utility. We'll enable developers to tell the AI what code to look at (the ""context"") and then run a command against it. This epic moves beyond simple prompts and makes the AI truly project-aware."
,E3,"Automation & Efficiency - Running Tasks in the Background","Some AI tasks take time. This epic is about giving that time back to the developer. We'll introduce features to run long jobs in the background and even chain simple steps together into automated workflows."
,E4,"The Magic Wand - Intelligent, Goal-Driven Actions","This is where Ferri starts to feel like magic. Instead of telling the AI *how* to do something step-by-step, the developer can just describe the goal. Ferri will then create and execute a plan to achieve it."
,E5,"Making it Great - Polish and User Experience","A powerful tool is only useful if people enjoy using it. This epic is focused on the details that create a polished, professional, and user-friendly experience. It's less about new features and more about making the existing features great."
