# Ferri Project Epics: From Simple Tool to Intelligent Partner

Hey there! This document outlines the five core "epics" for our sprint. Think of an epic as a big chapter in our product's story. Each one delivers a major piece of value to our users (developers like us!) and gets us closer to our goal of making Ferri an indispensable AI assistant.

### Epic 1: The Foundation - Getting Started with Ferri

**The Big Idea:** This is all about the "out-of-the-box" experience. When a developer first tries Ferri, they should be able to get it set up in their project and configured in minutes. This epic builds that smooth on-ramp and establishes the core building blocks of the tool.

**As a developer, I want to...**
*   Easily initialize Ferri in my project.
*   Securely store my sensitive API keys without having to paste them everywhere.
*   Quickly see all the local and remote AI models I have available to use.

**Key Features (The "How"):**
*   `ferri init`: The command that sets up a new project.
*   `ferri secrets`: A secure vault for API keys.
*   `ferri models`: A registry to manage and view available AI models.

**Why it Matters:** A great first impression is everything. This epic ensures the tool feels solid, secure, and easy to grasp from the moment a developer starts using it.

### Epic 2: The Core Workflow - Putting AI to Work

**The Big Idea:** This is the heart of Ferri's daily utility. We'll enable developers to tell the AI what code to look at (the "context") and then run a command against it. This epic moves beyond simple prompts and makes the AI truly project-aware.

**As a developer, I want to...**
*   Tell Ferri which files and folders are relevant for my current task.
*   Run a command or ask a question and have the AI automatically use that context to give me a smart, relevant answer.

**Key Features (The "How"):**
*   `ferri ctx`: The command for managing the project's context (adding files, listing them, etc.).
*   `ferri with`: The engine that runs a command, seamlessly injecting the context and secrets.

**Why it Matters:** This delivers on the core promise of Ferri: no more manually copy-pasting code into a prompt. This makes the AI a genuine, context-aware coding partner.

### Epic 3: Automation & Efficiency - Running Tasks in the Background

**The Big Idea:** Some AI tasks take time. This epic is about giving that time back to the developer. We'll introduce features to run long jobs in the background and even chain simple steps together into automated workflows.

**As a developer, I want to...**
*   Kick off a long-running AI job (like generating documentation) and not have my terminal be blocked.
*   Check the status of my background jobs and grab their output when they're done.
*   Define simple, repeatable multi-step workflows in a file to automate common tasks.

**Key Features (The "How"):**
*   `ferri run`: Runs a command as a background job.
*   `ferri ps`: Lists and manages active jobs.
*   `ferri yank`: Fetches the output of a completed job.
*   `ferri flow`: Runs a multi-step workflow from a file.

**Why it Matters:** This transforms Ferri from a command-line tool into a true productivity multiplier. It respects the developer's time and handles the waiting for them.

### Epic 4: The Magic Wand - Intelligent, Goal-Driven Actions

**The Big Idea:** This is where Ferri starts to feel like magic. Instead of telling the AI *how* to do something step-by-step, the developer can just describe the goal. Ferri will then create and execute a plan to achieve it.

**As a developer, I want to...**
*   Describe a complex change I need in plain English (e.g., "add a new API endpoint for users").
*   Have Ferri understand my goal, figure out the necessary steps, and make the code changes for me.

**Key Features (The "How"):**
*   `ferri do`: The "agentic" engine that takes a high-level goal and turns it into an executable plan.

**Why it Matters:** This is the "wow" feature. It represents the future of AI-assisted development, where the developer's role shifts from writing code to directing an intelligent system that writes the code for them.

### Epic 5: Making it Great - Polish and User Experience

**The Big Idea:** A powerful tool is only useful if people enjoy using it. This epic is focused on the details that create a polished, professional, and user-friendly experience. It's less about new features and more about making the existing features great.

**As a developer, I want to...**
*   See clear and helpful instructions when I'm not sure how to use a command.
*   Get sensible, easy-to-understand error messages when I make a mistake.
*   Have access to advanced options to customize how commands run (e.g., streaming output).

**Key Features (The "How"):**
*   Comprehensive help text for all commands.
*   Robust error handling and user feedback.
*   Command modifiers like `--stream`, `--dry-run`, etc.
*   Potentially interactive modes for a more guided experience.

**Why it Matters:** A fantastic user experience builds trust and turns a useful tool into a beloved one. It's the key to driving adoption and making Ferri a staple in a developer's toolkit.
