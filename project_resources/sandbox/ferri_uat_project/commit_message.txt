feat: Add timestamp formatting and file handling options

The script now supports custom timestamp formats and file handling options.

- Added `-f/--format` argument to specify the timestamp format.
- Added `-o/--overwrite` argument to overwrite the file instead of appending.
- Improved error handling for file not found and permission errors.
- Added newline character after each timestamp entry for better readability.
