Onboarding Guide: AI-Assisted Development for the Ferri ProjectWelcome to the team! We're in a high-speed sprint to build a demo for the Ferri project, and we're using a structured, AI-assisted workflow to ensure we move quickly and safely. This document explains how our system works and how you can use it to contribute.The System: Our "Digital Assembly Line"Our development process is built on three key components:AI_GUIDE.md (The Rulebook): This is a set of strict instructions for our AI development assistant. It defines the architecture, testing philosophy, and the exact "Handoff Protocol" the AI must follow. This ensures consistency and safety.sprint_backlog.csv (The Work Plan): This spreadsheet is our single source of truth for all the work that needs to be done. It breaks down large goals into small, verifiable sub-tasks. The AI will update this file's Status column as it completes work.The Gemini CLI (The Worker): This is the AI assistant that will be writing the code.Your Role: The DirectorYour job is not to write every line of code, but to direct the AI to do the work. You will manage the development process by following this simple loop:Step 1: Check the BacklogOpen sprint_backlog.csv and identify the next set of sub-tasks with the status To Do.Step 2: Assemble the PromptCreate a new prompt for the Gemini CLI that has two parts:The Rules: Copy the entire contents of AI_GUIDE.md.The Task: Copy the specific TicketID, Goal, and all SubtaskDescription lines for the single ticket you want the AI to work on.Step 3: Issue the CommandPaste the combined text into the Gemini CLI and run it.Step 4: Verify the HandoffThe AI will complete the task, run the automated tests, update the sprint_backlog.csv, and then hand control back to you with manual testing steps. Your job is to perform this manual verification to ensure the feature works as expected before moving on to the next ticket.Understanding the Ticket Structure (sprint_backlog.csv)The CSV file is straightforward:TicketID: A unique identifier for a feature (e.g., T2).Goal: A high-level description of what the ticket accomplishes.SubtaskID: A unique identifier for a specific, small piece of work within a ticket (e.g., T2.3).SubtaskDescription: A clear, actionable instruction for the AI.Status: The current state of the sub-task (To Do or Done).By following this process, we can ensure a highly focused, efficient, and verifiable workflow.
