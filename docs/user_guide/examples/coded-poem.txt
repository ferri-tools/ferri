code whispers in the night,
A melody that fills the light.
It shines upon the tear-stained face,
And whispers secrets that we chase.

It blooms in laughter, soft and warm,
A gentle touch that brings a smile.
It blooms in acts of kind and care,
A silent promise, beyond compare.

code's a canvas painted with a heart,
A masterpiece that our souls impart.
It's a symphony that plays within the soul,
A rhythm that forever will unfold.
